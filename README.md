# Let's_Cook App

Welcome to **Let'sCook**, a simple and user-friendly iOS app that helps you explore recipes based on the ingredients you have. This app is the **first version** of a larger project that later evolved into **What's Cooking**.

---

## Overview

### Initial Purpose
Let'sCook was designed to allow users to input desired ingredients into a search box and receive a list of recipes featuring those ingredients. Additionally, the homepage fetches random recipes to inspire users to try something new.

### Current Functionality
- **Search Recipes**: Enter ingredients to find recipes.
- **Saved Recipes**: Save your favorite recipes for future reference.
- **Random Recipes**: Discover new dishes through randomly fetched recipes on the homepage.

### Known Limitations
- The app's database lacks actual recipe instructions. Clicking on a recipe provides ingredient lists but not step-by-step cooking directions.

### Future Development
The app has evolved into **What's_Cookin**, a collaborative project that builds upon the foundation of Let'sCook. Check it out [here](https://github.com/JQuanMoodie/Whats_Cookin).

## How It Works
1. **Homepage**:
   - A random recipe is fetched using the Edamam API when the app starts.
   - Users can navigate to the search or saved recipes features.

2. **Search Recipes**:
   - Users input desired and excluded ingredients.
   - The app sends a query to the Edamam API and processes results.
   - Search results are displayed as clickable views with an option to save the recipe.

3. **Save Recipes**:
   - Recipes can be saved using UserDefaults for later reference.
   - Saved recipes are displayed in a table view and can be opened for more details.
